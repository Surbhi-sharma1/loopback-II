# loopback-II


For Client-Side

Created A table of User details wherein added a customers table and roles table in DB. Customer table columns - name, website, address. Role columns - name, key (must be from enum), description. Each user can belong to one customer and have one role and have Shown customer name and role name for each user in UI using angular(replacing TypeScript)
Also,
Add a new page to UI - Customers. Implement CRUD for customers in UI and integrate with API. There should be a button against each customer entry in UI saying "Show Users". Clicking on that should show users associated with that customer. One can perform CRUD for users from this page.
